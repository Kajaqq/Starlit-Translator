This file contains the system instructions for the model to follow.
It's the most important thing to ensure quality translations.
That's why it's recommended to change them for ones made specific for your domain.

The best way to do so is to write some guidelines in plain text and ask Gemini to 
'change these system instructions to be more understandable for an LLM like you.'
